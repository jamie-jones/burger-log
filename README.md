## DESCRIPTION

Do you want to eat a burger but you can't? Here, you have the Fishin' for a Burger application where you can pretend to eat one!

This application was difficult to put together, but after I was finally able to do it, the swell of pride made it all worth it. After hours of problem after problem after problem, restarting all together, and eating my feelings, I got this application the way I wanted it to look and I'm very proud of it! This was the project that truly reminded me how much I have learned since starting the course. I was able to find my own mistake and understand why they were mistakes and how they needed to be fixed, and because of that, I am beginning to feel more confident about my coding ability!
